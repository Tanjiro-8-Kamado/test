Gangooly's paintings betray the influence of Millet's elegiac mood and the twilight glow of his landscapes... Gangooly won fame for his atmospheric paintings of natural scenery, the spectacular Himalayan mountain ranges and the series on the Ganges in different moods. The works show a sensitive grasp of the drama, the variety of natural light and rich colours of the Indian landscape."" - Partha Mitter, reprinted in Art &amp; Nationalism in Colonial India, Cambridge University Press, 1994; p.111-112</p>
<p>""However, even the art-school-based westernised art of the time showed its own more mellowed strands of individualism and sophistication. J.P. Gangooly had come to specialize in a genre of dusky, atmospheric landscapes and riverscapes, and in romantic studies of peasant and country life, with a distinct resemblance of the works of French painters like Millet, Courbet or Jules Breton. With his family connections with the Tagores, J.P. Gangooly and his brand of melancholy 'mood' paintings, notwithstanding their western style and medium, could stand within the fluid peripheries of the new art movement."" - Tapati Guha-Thakurta, reprinted in The Making of a New 'Indian' Art, 1992; p.319<br /><br />""The works [of natural scenery] show a sensitive grasp of drama, the variety of natural light and rich colours of the Indian landscape."" - Partha Mitter, reprinted in Art &amp; Nationalism, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1994</p>

Gaganendranath has painted the boundless rice fields, the temple on the river, the rows of palm and coconut, the hills shrouded in storm and mist, the village in the evening, or the punting boatman, with the same sympathy and skill as he has painted city roofs bathed in moonlight. It was this intimate communion with both worlds that lent such mystery to his Bengal landscapes and human types."" - Asok Mitra, reprinted in Gaganendranath Tagore, Lalit Kala Contemporary 2, 1964; p.9</p>

<p>""To recapitulate this early and formative period of Gaganendranath's art activity, it can then be observed that his attitude was realistic. He aimed at representing direct visual experience on to the painting. He began with a broadly impressionist technique but depended heavily on Japanese technique and its variations. Thus it can be claimed that Japanese art greatly influenced his formative period, during the course of which he achieved a considerable mastery over the technique."" -Dr. Ratan Parimoo, reprinted in The Paintings of the Three Tagores, Maharaja Sayajirao University, Baroda, 1973; p.97</p>",,,0,0,0,,,2,,,,nd,Initialled in English 'GT' l.r.,,1,29.8,21, ,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Acquired by Chitrakoot Art Gallery from the Collection of Anirban Sannyasi of Kalyani, Nadia Dist., West Bengal</p>",,National Art Treasure | Non-Exportable Item,,,,Watercolour on paper,,

At the same time the fundamental difference between cubism proper (as represented by Braque and Picasso) and Gaganendranath's experiments should be obvious now. Cubism consists of volume analyses in terms of interpenetrating planes and closely defined space through horizontal vertical structure."" - Ratan Parimoo, reprinted in Gaganendranath Tagore NGMA 1996; p.74</p>
<p>""Cubism was a ""discovery"" of the West, as far as its formulae are concerned. Some of its roots, however, lie in the East. The mountain scenery painted in Ajanta, and the architecture, particularly in Kangra paintings, are visualised in a cubist way...Cubism, the most constructive of the new ways of creation, dislocated the solid volume and rebuilt it as a continuum of movement and change. By the reduction of reality to the simple forms of coherent cubes, an order, a new convention was found."" - Stella Kramrisch, extracted from her essay 'Gaganendranath Tagore : An Indian Cubist', reprinted in Gaganendranath Tagore</p>",,,0,0,0,,,2,,,,Mid 1920s,Initialled in English 'GT' l.r.,,1,46.5,32.2, ,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Previously from the Family Collection of Samarendranath Tagore (b/o Gaganendranath Tagore & Abanindranath Tagore) thereafter inherited by his son - Manindranath Tagore, and again by descent to his daughter - Shoma Chatterjee</p>",,National Art Treasure | Non-Exportable Item,,,,Watercolour on paper,,

Art historian Geeta Kapur records that the emphasis in these curriculum (sic) on life-drawing, expressed through sketches and paintings, ""formed the academic criteria for and against which subsequent movements in Indian art developed"". The formalism of academic art has undergone, over the decades, fierce critique from artists, art critics and art historians for espousing a romantic and glossed-over myth on everyday life divorced from the true grit of the human condition. However, in the second half of the twentieth century, academic art found a new lease through theoretical reconsideration of everyday life. Art was critically apprised outside of the normative formalist/modernist paradigm and located within daily ritualised/realist values of perspective. Academic art was reframed as a potential site of production and circulation of meanings. Where art history and criticism was unkind, art theory and cultural studies embraced. This provides the entry point for the contemporary appreciation of Mazumdar who like many artists of his period were not mere passive purveyors but critical respondents to the received formalism."" - Venka Purushothaman, reprinted in Caterina Corni &amp; Nirmalaya (EDs.), Hemen Mazumdar: The Last Romantic, Singapore: Singapore Management University, 2019; p.109-110</p>",,,0,0,0,,,1,,,,nd,Signed in English 'H Mazumdar' l.l.,,1,35.5,25.6, ,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Formerly from the Private Kolkata-based collection of Shri Jitendra Lal Banerjee (former Principal of Tirthapati Institution) which was directly acquired from the artist during the early 1950s; thereafter inherited by his daughter-in-law - Smt.

Langhammer brought into India Kokoschka's style of panoramic landscapes. Similar hues of colour were employed by Bendre to replace the mellow colour scheme of the existing Indore school as if to usher in the celebration of the Indian sunshine."" - Ratan Parimoo, in 'Indian Art Exhibition' reprinted in Exhibition Catalogue, N. S. Bendre: Indian Art Exhibition, Individuals Cultural Centre, 1992</p>
<p>""Interestingly, Bendre's work, beginning from the 1930s and continuing through the 1940s, largely aligns itself with the nineteenth century British artists who were fond of painting picturesque scenes from far off places in the exotic countryside as well as people of different ethnic and caste types. This necessarily required wide travelling and this 'wanderlust' took Bendre to many parts of India, even working on many jobs including the one in the Tourist Department of Kashmir. His selection of sites for his landscapes like Har Ki Pauri, Hardwar, Banaras Ghats, Omkareshwar, near Indore (1932) are typical. Prior to these 'pleine aire' landscapes of Bendre, there is hardly an Impressionist phase in any Indian painter in whose work one could observe the combining of atmospheric effects (generally of sunshine) with the break up of colour in terms of the spectrum."" - Ratan Parimoo, in 'Indian Art Exhibition' reprinted in Exhibition Catalogue, N.
